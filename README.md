Rent_Prediction_model using Streamlit Deployment Using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Project Goals
The goal of this project is to analyze the house rental dataset and build a predictive model that can estimate the rent of a house based on its features. The project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, preprocessing the data, selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm, tuning the model hyperparameters, and finally deploying the model using Streamlit.

# Benefits from Project
Market Insights:
Predicting house rent allows individuals, real estate agents, and property managers to gain insights into market trends. Understanding rent fluctuations helps stakeholders make informed decisions about pricing strategies.

Tenant Decision-Making:
Prospective tenants can benefit by having insights into expected rent prices. This information assists them in making informed decisions about where to live and whether a particular property is within their budget.
