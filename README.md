Rent_Prediction_model using Streamlit Deployment Using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Project Goals
The goal of this project is to analyze the house rental dataset and build a predictive model that can estimate the rent of a house based on its features. The project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, preprocessing the data, selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm, tuning the model hyperparameters, and finally deploying the model using Streamlit.
